# ⚡ Ticket Resolution App
### _A Flutter experience crafted with intention, depth… and a little suspense._

Before you dive into this repository, a gentle warning:  
This is not a minimal take-home test submission.  
This is a **fully realized, architected, animated, polished application** built to feel like a production-ready product - because you deserve to see how far a Flutter app can go when everything is done right.

If you’re ready, scroll on.

## 🌑 Prelude
You asked for a simple ticket app.

What you’ll find here is something slightly... more.

Every screen, gesture, transition, and animation has been deliberately tuned.  
Every architectural choice is intentional.  
Every line of state management is placed for long-term scalability.

The goal wasn’t to pass a test - it was to create an experience you’d want to explore.

## 🚀 What Awaits Inside

### 🔐 Authentication
A clean, minimal login flow with state persisted locally.  
Mocked backend. Real-world polish.  
When the app boots, it remembers you… or politely sends you home.

### 🎫 Tickets, Reimagined
Fetched from the public API, elevated through:

- Smooth staggered animations
- Shimmer placeholders while loading
- Pull-to-refresh
- Material Motion transitions
- Frosted glass overlays
- View switching between different layouts
- Subtle micro-interactions that bring the interface to life

Tap any ticket and the UI leans in with clarity, motion, and intention.

### 🟢 Mark as Resolved
Resolution states persist locally — clean, instant, reliable.  
Powered by **Hive**, managed through a scalable architecture that makes future features trivial to extend.

---

## 🧭 Navigation
Built with **GoRouter**, wrapped in elegant redirection logic and guarded flows.  
Every transition is intentional — sliding, fading, or transforming with Material Motion.

---

## 🎨 The Visual Experience
Crafted with **pure Material You theming**, not approximated.  
Color harmonization, elevation, shadow treatment, typographic rhythm… tuned.

You’ll find:

- Material 3 principles
- Soft surfaces
- Clean typography
- Intentional Motion
- Frosted glass effects
- Dicebear-generated avatars
- Adaptive dark and light modes
- UI that bends gently to your device size

This isn’t just “following a design system.”  
It’s expressing it.

## 🧩 Architecture (The Superstructure Beneath The Shine)

This app is built as if it were shipping to real users:

- **Clean Architecture**
- **MVVM Pattern**
- **BLoC/Cubit** for state
- **Dependency Injection**
- **Repository Pattern**
- **Domain-driven structure**
- **Local storage abstraction (Hive + SharedPrefs)**  

Organized. Scalable. Predictable. Ready for growth.

### ✨ Why This Matters

This project is both a solution and a demonstration —
not just of Flutter skill,
but of craftsmanship, architectural discipline, design intuition, and attention to detail.

The requirement was to build a ticket app.
The opportunity was to show what a refined Flutter experience can look like.

And that’s exactly what this repository contains.

### 📝 Final Note

Thank you for taking the time to explore this project.
If the code, craft, or polish resonates with you,
I’d be excited to carry this same level of energy and excellence into the InterIntel team.

**Dive in - the app is waiting.**
